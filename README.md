# The-Java-HotelX-Project - DEMO LINK: https://gifted-meitner-56ed56.netlify.app/
This is a JAVA Project designed for Bidding/ Trading Hotel Rooms on the HotelX Bidding System designed during my Sophomore Year as a part of the OOP Java course @ NIE Mysore.

Course Code: IS4C04

Course Instructor: Mr. Suhaas KP, Assistant Professor, Department of Information Science and Engineering, The National Institute Of Engineering, Mysuru 570008

TOPIC: HotelX - Hotel Exchange

AIM: To provide for a better system to book hotels @ cheaper prices and to disrupt the existing system of Fixed price Booking by using the Floating/Demand-Supply Exchange Operation, similar to Equity Stock Exchanges.

Concepts Illustrated:
* Abstraction- Classes.
* Scope and Lifetime of variables.
* Declaring objects.
* Instance Variables of different data types.
* Constructors/Methods.
* 'this' keyword.
* Inheritance.
* Overloading (Constructors)
* Overriding.
* Objects as parameters.
* Access control mechanism.
* Use of 'super'.
* Packages.
* Interfaces.
* Exception Handling.
* Creation of thread to execute a certain process.
* Few string handling mechanisms.
* Usage of URI.

The program is divided into two files in two packages in order to illustrate the concept of Packages in Java.

Project Conclusion: This project successfully completes its 2 primary objectives
* 1) Enables User to BID for Lower prices
* 2) Clears Hotel Inventories in Bulk, thus enhancing Room occupancy.

Finally, it can be said that this JAVA project can be exponentially scaled up by integrating Latest technologies and Frameworks for Deployment across millions of hotel rooms across the globe.

Project Epilogue :
Everyday millions of hotel rooms go unsold, thus creating huge inventory losses for both hotels and the hotel industry. Consequently, customers complain about high prices of hotel rooms. This problem is totally avoidable, inspired by the stock market where everything is influenced by demand and supply. HotelX or HotelExchange is a bidding platform for hotels and travel agents where hotel rooms are bid on a daily basis. Using JAVA, we would accept bids from travel agents and automatically accept the highest bid, thus creating a smooth bidding process. Finally, after payment of 50% of the bid amount, the program will display the invoice/booking details of winning bid on the console. This marks the end of the bidding process. Thus, both hotels and customers get the best deals.
